    <span></span>
    <p class="content1">
        Asch is an efficient, flexible and safe decentralized application platform, which was initially designed to lower the threshold / barrier to entry for developers. With the use of JavaScript as its application programming language, the platform makes use of relational databases to store data, drawing similarities between developing a DAPP and developing a traditional web application.  This type of platform carries a great deal of appeal to developers, as well as small and medium enterprises, since its ease of use results in greater productivity, fuelling and facilitating a more prosperous ecosystem in the process. Asch is open in design and is not limited to any particular niche market such as finance, document storage, copyright certification, etc. The APIs which it provides are underlying and abstract, and  they can be combined freely so as to  facilitate a variety of applications. In terms of the consensus mechanism, Asch has inherited and enhanced the DPOS algorithm, simultaneously reducing the probability of forking and double spending by a significant degree. Furthermore, Asch's side chain, i.e. the application mode, not only improves scalability by delaying the expansion of the blockchain, but also makes DAPPs more flexible and personalized. Asch is a forward-looking, low-cost and one-stop application solution, which is believed to be a new generation of incubator for decentralized application.
    </p>
    <h3>The services provided by  the Asch platform include a public chain and a set of application SDKs.</h3>
    <span></span>
    <p class="content2">The services provided by  the Asch platform include a public chain and a set of application SDKs; the public chain is called  the main chain. The Asch application SDKs can be used to develop blockchain applications with a free-running, immutable ledger. These applications are also known as side chain applications. An application SDK has a built-in cross-chain protocol, through which the side chain can communicate with the main chain. In other words, the main chain has the function of asset routing, through which a variety of assets can flow among different applications. Asch's ecological system contains multiple chains, with each chain possessing the ability to carry multiple tokens or assets.  Each token or asset can also be transferred to multiple chains.

            <li>
                <span>Application management</span>
                <p>Applications need to register meta-information into the main chain before issuing it. The meta-information includes the name and description of the application, the initial witness, and other relevant configuration information for the asset routing. Users can browse, retrieve, trace, download and visit  decentralized applications through the module.

                <span>Asset routing</span>
                <p>The assets registered on the main-chain can communicate with each application via cross-chain. Although applications are separated from each other, the flow of value could be realized through the asset routing function of the main chain.</p>

            <li>
                <span>Asset management</span>
                <p>Any account can register and issue multiple assets, and the issuer can configure the assets in various ways, for example, through the use of an  access control list.</p>

                <span>Delegate management</span>
                <p>Each account with tokens on the Asch main-chain can be registered as a delegate, which is also known as a  “witness”. The top 101 delegates are given the opportunity and responsibility of being  the system's account keepers, including  the right to forging (or mining, accounting and generating blocks) which results in the reward of  a certain amount of tokens.  The account keepers can be promoted via the vote of the token holders, who are able to vote for any delegate, to raise their ranking.

            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Account management</span>
                <p>The account model is adopted at the lower level of Asch chain. Each private key corresponds to an account in which  the basic user information such as the wallet address, public key,  nickname, as well as  other configuration information or statistical information is stored. As all application chains use the same account model, an account on the Asch chain is able to use the functions of all applications directly.</p>

    <span class="featuresLine"></span>
    <p>We believe that the blockchain itself is essentially a distributed database without a traditional central administrator, regardless of changes brought by the blockchain technology to the internet and social organization structure. The data is organized on the blockchain and is immutable for cryptographic principles. Since it is essentially a database, all business logic that can be realized by traditional databases, such as mySQL and Oracle, can also be realized on blockchains now. The only thing that has to be considered is whether or not it is necessary to use blockchain technology. In other words, does a  trust problem exist in the relevant business scenario? Does the relevant business need to be decentralized? Is it necessary to build a more effective incentive mechanism by using a blockchain token? If the answer is yes, Asch is able to satisfy the demands.
    </p>
    <!--<p>The data is organized in blockchain and anti-tampering by using cryptography.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Asch platform can be applied to the following application scenarios, but is not limited to them.</p>-->
    <h3>The Asch platform can be applied to the following application scenarios, but is not limited to them.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Content publishing platform</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>token incentive, value transfer, group wisdom</span>
            <p>On the internet, large enterprises deliver content which users are interested in by analyzing their reading habits, thus enabling them to capitalize on their behaviour. At the same time, the algorithm also creates a niche, which deprives users of their rights of choice and cognizance. However, through the use of the decentralization feature of the blockchain, the most interesting news in the community can be selected through the help of the group wisdom of the users. Meanwhile, the token incentive mechanism can be applied since its economic mechanism is able to stimulate the participant’s enthusiasm. This solves the problem of quality content being difficult to identify and to realize. The value will therefore return to its creators and deliverers, allowing for it to be shared by all participants.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Market prediction</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>token incentive, value transfer, public participation</span>
            <p>Market prediction is the collection of indicators of confidence and judgment from different parties regarding the same topic, based on market principles, so as topredict the future result of an event. The blockchain is distributed, open, transparent and immutable. We believe that it is able to solve the issue of insufficient credibility which exists in traditional prediction platforms. This solution establishes a credible, autonomous, value-transitive and extensible platform for market prediction. The platform will be able to predict upcoming events with the aid of senior wisdom derived from large-scale co-operation, attracting more people to participate in the process by utilizing the built-in token incentive.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Exchange platform</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>safety, decentralization, low fee, anonymity, scalability</span>
            <p>The exchange platform, which is based on distributed blockchain technology, is an important part of Asch's ecology. Asch represents a new generation of blockchain application development platforms,  based on side chain technology. On the platform, a number of excellent projects and many different types of tokens will be created and developed. At this moment in time, the system and functionality of the exchange platform  represents the basic demand requirement from many users, since it includes a wide array of features such as decentralization, disintermediation, safety, low fees, anonymity, and scalability, which other exchange platforms do not have. With side chain technology, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other high-quality projects can become interconnected, allowing for streamlined circulation of digital assets, whilst eliminating isolation amongst them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Social media</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>value network, data, private</span>
            <p>Internet based social media companies plunder user production data and unilaterally consume users through protocols which users are forced to comply with. Users are not able to fully enjoy the benefits of creating, establishing and maintaining their own community. As a result,  social media based on the main-chain distributed technology is a trend of future development. With the decentralization feature of the blockchain, it is able to achieve data and value freedom. Furthermore, through the use of the built-in token mechanism, a complete, positive-feedback value, stimulative economic system will be established so as to promote the development of the entire ecosystem.

            <span>IP Copyright protection</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>tractability, value incentive</span>
            <p>The popularity of the IP economy has made many peopole aware of the importance of IP, and IP mostly comes from literary works, which highlights the importance of copyright. The biggest difficulty of copyright protection is to collect evidence in circulation. Circulation is uncontrollable, so comprehensive protection of copyright cannot be assured. Blockchain technology is able to greatly reduce piracy, by providing protection to the entire ecosystem in the form of copyright which features traceability and immutability. The rights in the process of creation can be simultaneously and permanently stored in the blockchain; creating evidence for future potential disputes to be resolved easily.
            </p>

        <li>
            <span>Public donation</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>transparency, safety, decentralization</span>
            <p>The essence of public donation is a process of social wealth redistribution. The goal, amount and execution of wealth redistribution are determined by public organizations. Nowadays, the biggest contradiction in the public welfare field is the demand for public donations to account for the loss of their credibility. The inherent features of decentralization, transparency and immutability of the blockchain make the acceptance, donation and all other operations inherently exposed to the public, breaking any distrust between donors and executors.
